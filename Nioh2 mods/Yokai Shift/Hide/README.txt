so this mod does 4 things :

◼ Changes hide's Blue eyes to Red during Yokai Shift

◼ Changes Bodyglow on Yokai from golden to mixed Red/Black

◼ Changes the Bodycolor of Yokai to mixed Black/Gray

◼ Changes Horn type (1) to a Cooler one


IMPORTANT NOTE :

1-i uploaded 4 separate files , one for horn , one for eye , one for bodyglow , one for body recolor. so you can download whichever you want if you don't like the others , you can also download all 4 files to get the full set (just like in the images) , so its your choice. (AND YES IT WORKS FOR BOTH MALE AND FEMALE)

2-sadly, i can't change yokai shift's weapon aura from their original orange/blue/purple color to that red/black because it actually messes up the lighting in the game and other weapons so i won't touch that.

3-my main goal was to actually make a devilish form of hide's yokai shift, so i used mixture of 2 masterpiece demon forms to make this , Otakemaru's demon form AND Mitsunari Ishida's demon form (from nioh1). and yes , the horns belong to mitsunari ishida's demon form! (i couldn't port the tail sadly)

4-let me know if anything is off so i can fix it , if you have any questions about my mods or modding or even requesting something , just let me know ;
