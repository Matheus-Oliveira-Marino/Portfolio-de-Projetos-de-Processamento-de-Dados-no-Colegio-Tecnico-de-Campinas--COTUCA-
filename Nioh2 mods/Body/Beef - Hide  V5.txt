Only underwear versions , If you want a nude version well your free to edit and change anything to try and make one. Ive failed but its not impossible.  you would need to know how to make a  nude-midsection. Then do proper UV-editing, then proceed to make custom skin textures,tattoos for it,etc. then test it out  in-game then upload it. repeat process if you want options/variety.
(or just use repalcer version for nude body)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------N2-Body replacer Boob/Butt sizes have been moved here
: Replacer edits - this does not include yokai form changes

Breast/chest sizes for Default body can be found here WR - Boobs sizes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Main Mod Below


if you find my sizes too exaggerated you can try their Thicker thighs and butt



Bigger Beef - Hide (default Lower body) - for those who don't use N2-replacer body

for users of the default body (non-replacer users)
Can be used with the wrap removal mod
should be usable without other body mods
may conflict with any body replacer or the thick thighs mod
can work with any skin tone
will add variety with different shapes/sizes or just ask specifically
will cause clipping with some pants sets as they don't adapt to butt sizes, if you want me to modify an armor set to adjust to the  lower body changes let me know (what pants and what version body type your using)
if you want different colors for some of the gear just let me know specifically
most sizes come with only undies mod that "may" conflict with other mods that edit thieves grieves

an optional oily full body skin for wrap removal and/or for  wrapped  default bodies
makes the full body and chest oiled. is compatible with Beef versions or if using no changes

Yokai Forms - for default body - may work for replacer users

All forms share the same color choice
Feral/brute/Phantom form have chest size options
Weapon colors is not included atm - May add later
if you want more colors for all the forms let me know which ones
does not work with motion blur on BUT


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-I have  outfits from other games
ï»¿if there is a lower body size for non-replacer outfits you want compatible with these versions then let me know, if it isn't available
