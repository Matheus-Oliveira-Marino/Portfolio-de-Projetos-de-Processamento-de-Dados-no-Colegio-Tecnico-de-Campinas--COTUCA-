Wrap  removal - boob sizes

may be clipping or other issues due to size increase so ill try to fix them if possible
these sizes only show when nude- they wont reflect the armored chest wrapped removal versions unless i change those to reflect nude shapes
as of right now the chest sizes are not compatible with the chest wrap armor options yet
yes i will add more types of sizes.shapes at some point
Can be increased or decreased in character creation menu
I ask if people who are interested would give ideas and or pictures of what kind of sizes/version you would like to use
I can try to create or shape from the references
if you would like to make armor for any of the sizes you are free to do so, that's not my forte
I can  try to adjust the armor for any of the chest sizes but there aren't that many
keep in mind the boob physics wont reflect larger sizes properly. (as in giant boobs will still bounce as if its still smaller)


Chest bumps - Armor
i added boob space to certain chest armors that don't reflect your characters  increased boob size
you can let me know what armored chest, you would like to see added here

Nip rings
atm its only for default boobs - need to request for other chest variations
textures may conflict with each other when using stomach with any of the nip accessories
