Remake of my old sohayamaru weapon mod from here that i made 2 years ago.


-------------------------------------------------------------
Comes with 2 versions :

-With Glow
-Without Glow

NOTE : USE ONLY ONE!
-------------------------------------------------------------

Replaces Usumidori



i tried to make it similar to original sohayamaru from the game, don't just rely on the images because the sword might look different in each map (raining-night maps/ sunny-foggy maps/etc) but that's only because the lighting effects.

snakegaidenx already made a sohayamaru mod in here , so , just use whichever you want , i just made this mod for a request and also because that old sohayamaru weapon mod i made wasn't good-looking so i wanted to give it another try but from scratch.
