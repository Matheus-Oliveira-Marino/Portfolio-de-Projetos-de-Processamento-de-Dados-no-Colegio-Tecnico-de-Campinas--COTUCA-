ALL CREDIT GOES TO: Alpaca21 and MurabitoHyk

If you want to use this clothing mod without MurabitoHyk's Female Body Replacer, download the original one made by Alpaca21: https://www.nexusmods.com/nioh2/mods/121




Must use High Quality texture.
Compatible with Motion Blur.


This mod replaces:
- Shinobi Robes
- Onmyo Hunting Hakama


Note: I haven't yet tested every optional file, so if you encounter any error or bug, tell me.


Installation:
1. Download the Main Files zip (Default setting is backless heaven set color, white underwear, and wrapless).

(OPTIONAL) Download the optional files:
Other sets color with back and backless options
Other panties colors
Use wrap or hide it.
Use panties or hide it.
Then replaces the files inside the 01_Shinobi Robes folder with the optional files inside the zip.

2. Extract the 01_Shinobi Robes folder inside into the Mods folder.
3. Start the game and press F10.


Known issues:
- Hakama colors might not change; this problem only existed in the Chinese version of the game. This can be fixed by simply entering a mission (unconfirmed).
- Wrong texture for Sakura option, to fix do:
1. For the With Back option rename the Hakama.dds to shinobi_t0.dds and shinobi_t0.dds to Hakama.dds
2. For the Backless option replace the Hakama.dds with the shinobi_t0.dds from the With Back option.
