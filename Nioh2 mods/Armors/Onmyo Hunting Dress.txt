Onmyo Hunting Garb modified to be more tightly-fitting, and Onmyo Hunting Hakama without pants. Includes edited textures with 10 color options.

I made this to go with my Genmei Flats mod. There are already mods similar to this outfit, but I wanted one with sleeves. Didn't know what to name it.
Not really happy with it. The torso is particularly kinda boring. I couldn't remove the inner shirt because there are big holes in the torso. I also couldn't edit the front/back hanging cloth mesh. It won't load into Blender.

Changelog:
- Fixed incorrect folder name for all optional files.
- Added an option to remove the sleeves.

Notes:
- Requires Nioh 2 Mod Enabler.
- IMPORTANT: If the mod doesn't work, try disabling motion blur, setting texture quality to high, and disabling DLSS.

Installation:
Unzip the archive of your choice (with folders) into Steam\Steamapps\common\Nioh2\Mods\
Optional files are unzipped after, with overwriting.
If the mod doesn't work, try disabling motion blur, setting texture quality to high, and disabling DLSS.

Uninstallation:
Delete the mod folders, or if you want to keep the mod around, rename the folders to have DISABLED at the start.
For example: OnmyoHuntingDress -> DISABLED OnmyoHuntingDress

I would like to emphasize that none of this would've been possible without the hard work of the people listed here.
