RECOLORS :
currently there are 10 recolors , for both outfit and the weapon :
1-Black
2-Cyan
3-Grey
4-Green
5-Orange
6-Pink
7-Purple
8-Red
9-White
10-Yellow

How to add wished colors to the outfit? download the texture colors file and drop them in the main folder , "weapon" textures should go in "Okatsu_Weapon" folder and "outfit" textures should go in "Okatsu_Outfit" folder

Shiny effects works with ALL colors.

Also you can customize your weapon/outfit colors separate , for example , Red Outfit with Black Weapon


Notes :


1- This Outfit is useable for female only , but the weapon can be used as both male and female

2- Weapon's size doesn't affect their attack range

3- I highly recommend using the full outfit set , combining it with different armors parts might not look good most of the times

4-  due to some issues , i had to include okatsu's legs , the legs are part of Okatsu's body so... their color won't change if you change your character's skin color , but i can edit it for you if you want , also you can do it too by just editing the "Okatsu.dds" file

5- both weapon and armor have "Shiny/Oily Effects" as option which u can activate by placing the "Okatsu222.dds" file from the "Shiny/Oily" folder to the main folder

6- Cyan color of the sword can't use "Shiny/Oily Effects"

7- check the images to see how options affect the outfit

8- color files only include the textures , you will need to download the main file in order to use the color textures

9- that's all , if you have any problem/question about my mods or even asking for commission , please let me know ,
