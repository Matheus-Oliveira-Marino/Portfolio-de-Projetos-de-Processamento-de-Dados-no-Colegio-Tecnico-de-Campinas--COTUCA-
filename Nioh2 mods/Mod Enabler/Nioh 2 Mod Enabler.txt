Installation:
       
Extract the contents of 7z folder into the game directory (where nioh2.exe is located)

Keys:
        
F1: Show help

F2: Toggle mods off and on

Shift+F2: Cycle mod shadow modes (on/off/original)

Mouse back button: Toggle HUD off and on

F10: Reload all mods (Use it upon adding/enabling/disabling new mods)

Ctrl+Alt+F10: Reload all mods and reset to default configuration

        -------------------------------------------------------------------

Two example mods included:
        
Fundoshi Flap Removal - Disabled by default

Hide's Blade Removal - Disabled by default

To enable/disable mods:
        
Inside the "Mods" folder rename folders for the mods you want to enable by removing "DISABLED" in their name, and vice versa for disabling them.
After changes ( F10 ) in-game to refresh mods

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Issues:
 
-Some mods might not work if you not using maximum graphics settings
    
-There's a small potential for some things in the mods I
included to share hashes with something in the later levels of the game
so beware, if you notice some effects missing please report
        
-Currently mesh replacement results in inverted normal map, I
do not possess knowledge to fix this so any help would be appreciated.
This does affect Fundoshi mod. More testing needs to be done in general
on mesh replacement

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A few more notes: my hopes for someone with more knowledge on
3DMigoto/writing shaderfixes to pick this up, hopefully with the help of
people smarter than me Nioh 2 could have striving modding community.
If any parties behind 3DMigoto is not okay with this "release" I'll remove it immediately

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I have done minimal amount of changes to get this working with Nioh 2, all credit goes to
DarkStarSword / ausgeek , main developer behind 3DMigoto and DOAXVV Base Costume + 3D Vision Mod Support 2.3 this is based on
